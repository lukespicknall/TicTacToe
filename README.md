The Tic Tac Toe project in Odin. The project uses Javascript to create an 
interactive Tic Tac Toe game, CSS to create a felxible and responsive browser
interface for desktop and mobile play, and HTML as the bones to hang it all on.

The primary goal of the project is to demonstrate knowledge of factory functions,
modules, and other object-oriented tools to create an organzied code structure 
to handle all aspects of the game while revealing as few elements as possible 
into the global scope. Objects, like players, are created by passing values into the
Player factory function that contains the objects methods. Other functionality
is created in a mix of factory functions and modules to house each functionality section
and only revealing the desired elements of the game interaction to the global scope. 
Values and actions are housed inside other function's scopes for better security.
